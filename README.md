# staxly

> a GitHub App built with [probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) that runs a bot with plugins used by OpenStax

# Features

These are features coded into the bot:

- automatically create a Card when a user reacts with a `:github:` and link to the slack chat
- link-back : When someone mentions a channel in a message, that channel gets a link back to the original message
  - This is useful for notifying multiple groups, or casually asking for help
- Reminder to add a Pull Request Reviewer
- React when a user types `staxly ping` (verify the bot is up)

See [Issues](https://github.com/openstax/staxly/issues) for feature requests.
